# Product Requirement Document: Navigability and Search

## Last Updated - April 26, 2025

Goal: to increase the usability of the app when choosing from a larger inventory (going from 10 inventory items in development testing to more than 100 in buildout)

How: 
- Describe the feature very specifically and use AI-coder
- Steal great ideas like the sidebar navigation from climatetriage.com

## Sidebar implementation on climatetriage.com
